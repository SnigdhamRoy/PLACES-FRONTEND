MERN PROJECT
In this project, the frontend is responsible for handling user inputs such as sign-up and login, as well as managing places â€” including updating, editing, deleting, and viewing them on a map.

The frontend is built using ReactJS as a Single Page Application (SPA).
Core pages and routing have been implemented.
Components have been modularized, and CSS styling has been applied for a clean and organized UI.
